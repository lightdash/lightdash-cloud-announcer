```

### Install all dependencies and run the app

```bash
# Install all the project's dependencies
yarn

# Run the app locally
yarn start

# Open another terminal window and Run ngrok
yarn expose
```

### Update events address to test 

In this example we will be testing the `/listblocked` Slack command

Go to the [Slack commands page](https://api.slack.com/apps/A033CLM638C/slash-commands?saved=1) on your Slack settings, choose the command you would like to test and click on the edit button.

![Slack command page](/static/screenshots/slack-command.png)

Once there replace the base url in the `Request URL` field with the last `Forwarding` url that running ngrok returns.

Click save, and try going to a slack channel to test the command. `/listblocked`

You should be able to see the requests coming in the `Web interface` url that running ngrok returns, with all the detailed information of the event. this is very helpful to debug.

> Note: Make sure to install the app into slack workspace whenever you make changes to permissions etc. From the config homepage
